# Java GUI Registration and Statistics System

This exercise consists of two Java GUI applications: `Registration` and `Statistic`. Each application serves a specific purpose related to managing student records and calculating statistics based on exam scores.

## Registration Class:

The `Registration` class represents a simple registration form GUI. It allows users to input student information, including first name, last name, and exam score. Upon clicking the "Add" button, the entered student records are stored in a text file (`file.txt`). The class demonstrates the use of Swing components such as labels, text fields, and buttons, as well as basic file I/O operations for data storage.

## Statistic Class:

The `Statistic` class provides a GUI for calculating statistics based on student exam scores. It includes buttons for calculating the number of successful and failed students and text fields for displaying the results. Upon clicking the respective buttons, the class reads student records from the `file.txt` file, calculates the statistics, and displays the results in the corresponding text fields.
